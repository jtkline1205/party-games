# codenames
A game of Codenames.

Gameplay:

25 words are randomly selected from the word bank and are arranged in a 5x5 grid.

The codemasters choose a grid layout card, which determines the colors of the words as well as the turn order.

The codemasters take turns giving one-word clues to their teams, and the teams choose the words they think correspond to the clues. 

The game is over when one team has correctly guessed all their words, or one team has chosen the black card.
