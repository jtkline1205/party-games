# codenames

When a new game is started:

1. 25 words are randomly selected from the word bank and are arranged in a 5x5 grid.

2. The codemasters choose a grid layout card, which determines the colors of the words as well as the turn order.

3. The codemasters take turns giving clues to their teams. A clue consists of a single word and a number. The guessing team can then begin choosing words one at a time until either:

  a. They guess a neutral card, an enemy card, or the black card.
  b. They run out of guesses, where the number of guesses allowed is the clue number + 1.

4. The game is over when one team has correctly guessed all their words, or one team has chosen the black card.

When a new game is started:

1. Both the red and blue players are given 5 ships with varying lengths:
##### Carrier - 5
##### Battleship - 4
##### Cruiser - 3
##### Submarine - 3
##### Destroyer - 2

2. The players arrange their 5 ships secretly on a 10x10 grid (where the grid squares are labeled by letter and number).
3. The players take turns calling shots against the opponent. The player being fired at announces whether the shot was a hit or miss.
4. A player has won when they have scored hits on all parts of all 5 of their opponent's ships.
