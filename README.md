# codenames

When a new game is started:

1. 25 words are randomly selected from the word bank and are arranged in a 5x5 grid.

2. The codemasters choose a grid layout card, which determines the colors of the words as well as the turn order.

3. The codemasters take turns giving clues to their teams. A clue consists of a single word and a number. The guessing team can then begin choosing words one at a time until either:

  a. They guess a neutral card, an enemy card, or the black card.
  b. They run out of guesses, where the number of guesses allowed is the clue number + 1.

4. The game is over when one team has correctly guessed all their words, or one team has chosen the black card.
